# AI Safety Incident Dashboard

This is a React.js-based web application designed to monitor and analyze AI safety-related incidents. The dashboard provides visual insights into the incidents based on severity, timelines, popular tags, and other safety aspects. It also allows users to report new incidents and search through existing reports.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

Download Node.js and npm from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   bash
   git clone https: https://github.com/Sreehari2710/SafeGuard-AI.git
   

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   bash
   cd ai-safety-incident-dashboard
   

3. Install the required dependencies:

   bash
   npm install
   

### Running the Application Locally

Start the development server:

bash
npm start


The app will open automatically in your browser at:  
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Any code changes will reload the page automatically.

### Building the Application

To create a production-ready build:

bash
npm run build


This will create an optimized build in the build/ folder.
