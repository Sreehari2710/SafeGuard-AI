    title: "LLM Hallucination in Critical Info",
    description: "Large Language Model provided incorrect safety procedure information to industrial client, potentially endangering workers. The model confidently generated fabricated safety protocols that contradicted standard industry practices. Immediate containment measures have been implemented including human review of all safety-related outputs.",

    title: "Facial Recognition False Positives",
    description: "Security system reported unusually high rate of false positive matches for certain demographic groups. Initial investigation suggests lighting conditions and camera positioning may be contributing factors. Engineering team is collecting more diverse training data and recalibrating the similarity thresholds.",
